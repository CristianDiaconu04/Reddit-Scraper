<h1>Reddit Scraper</h1> 
<a href="https://skillicons.dev"> <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python"/> </a>

<p> I created a basic reddit scraper in python using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) which can fetch information on both subreddits and users. The user can choose to scrape subreddits for X amount of posts based on the 4 reddit sorting methods (new/hot/top/controversial). The program then outputs 
the X latest posts based on the given sorting method, and the user can then decide whether they want more information on any of the posts or not. When scraping for reddit users, the program outputs user profile information of the given username. </p>
